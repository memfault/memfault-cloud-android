<h2>MemfaultCloud Android</h2>
<p>The <code>MemfaultCloud</code> library provides convenience APIs for mobile applications
that interact with Memfault's web services.</p>
<h3>Sample App</h3>
<p>The <code>sample/</code> directory contains a very basic Android application that
demonstrates the functionality of this library.</p>
<p>Before building the app, make sure to update the Project API key in
<code>SampleViewModel.kt</code>.</p>
<h3>Adding the SDK to your project</h3>
<p>Add the library to your application's <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-groovy">dependencies {
  implementation 'com.memfault.cloud.sdk:1.0.0-RC1'
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Initialization</h4>
<p>The <a href="com.memfault.cloud.sdk/-memfault-api/index.html">MemfaultApi</a> class is the
main entry point for the <code>MemfaultCloud</code> SDK. We recommend creating only one
<code>MemfaultApi</code> instance and using it across your entire application.</p>
<h4>Getting the latest release</h4>
<p>Use the
<a href="com.memfault.cloud.sdk/-memfault-api/get-latest-release.html">memfaultApi.getLatestRelease</a>
API to query Memfault's services to find if a new update is available for a
device.</p>
<h4>Uploading Chunks</h4>
<p>The Memfault Firmware SDK packetizes data to be sent to Memfault's cloud into
"chunks". See
<a href="https://docs.memfault.com/docs/embedded/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud">this tutorial for details</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have established sending chunks from your device to the Android app,
use the
<a href="com.memfault.cloud.sdk/-memfault-chunk-sender/index.html">MemfaultChunkSender</a>
API to upload these chunks to Memfault.</p>
